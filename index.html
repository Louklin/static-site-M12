        <h2>What's Wrong and How to Fix It:</h3>

        <div id="explanation">
            <p><strong>Flaws:</strong><br>
                The does looks like it was deisign during the early days of the internet, it doesn't have a coherent structure and its layout is cluttered.<br>
                It seems that it lays out all of its content, like articles and pictures that are not properly optimized, on the same page, leading to long wait times when accessing the website.<br>
                It also lacks certain features that are commonly found in most modern websites, such as a menu bar, a search bar
            </p>

            <p><strong>Improvements:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Color Scheme:** Adopt a **minimalist color palette** (e.g., a dark/light base, one accent color) to improve readability and reduce visual stress.</li>
               
            </ul>
